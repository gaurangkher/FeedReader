The 28-year-old was finally pulled out of the rubble on Tuesday, Reuters reports, by a Nepali-French rescue team combing the capital city for survivors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems he survived by sheer willpower,&rdquo; said Akhilesh Shreshtha, a doctor who treated him, after it appeared that Khanal had no access to food or water for three days and escaped with nothing but a possible broken leg.</p>
<p>Khanal&rsquo;s rescue was a heartening but rare story from the devastation in Nepal, where a 7.8 magnitude earthquake over the weekend killed more than 5,000 people. That toll is sure to rise significantly as rescue teams move away from Kathmandu, which they began to do early Wednesday, and reach devastated villages near the quake&rsquo;s epicenter.</p>
<div class="galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded" data-gallery="3835855" data-size="default"></div>
<p>Nepalese Prime Minister Sushil Koirala said the total number of lives lost <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2015/04/28/quake-nepal-aid-idINKBN0NI1AT20150428" target="_blank">could ultimately exceed 10,000</a>. &ldquo;The government is doing all it can for rescue and relief on a war footing,&rdquo; Koirala told Reuters. &ldquo;It is a challenge and a very difficult hour for Nepal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More than 450,000 people have reportedly been displaced from their homes. As <a href="http://time.com/3838963/nepal-earthquake-kathmandu-airport/" target="_blank">international aid teams</a> from countries like India, China, Pakistan, the U.S., Israel and several others arrive and commence operations, there is also growing concern about the spread of disease and lack of food and water in rural areas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The situation is much more worrying in those districts,&rdquo; Samuel Marie-Fanon, the regional rapid response coordinator for the European Commission&rsquo;s humanitarian aid and civil protection department, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/reports-landslide-buries-remote-trekking-village-in-latest-nepal-tragedy/2015/04/28/d961dd1a-ed26-11e4-8050-839e9234b303_story.html?postshare=281430276952758" target="_blank">told</a> the <em>Washington Post</em>. &ldquo;The big rains have started, and all this week people are sleeping in the open. There is an obvious need for shelter and tents or tarpaulins. The priorities are water, food and, of course, medical assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Periodic landslides and relentless rain continue to hamper rescue efforts in districts like Sindupalchowk, about 50 miles from Kathmandu and one of the worst affected areas. Houses in the district have been completely destroyed, the <em>Post </em>reported, with nothing but heaps of rubble piled over bodies.</p>
<p>The <em>Post</em> also wrote about Ratna Kumari Shreshtha, an elderly woman brought to Kathmandu after being rescued from Sindupalchowk. She expressed the grief and helplessness sweeping the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No houses left, no houses left,&rdquo; the paper quoted her as saying. &ldquo;Everything is finished.&rdquo;</p>

seven-storey building he was in collapsed around him during Saturday&rsquo;s massive earthquake in downtown Kathmandu. The 28-year-old was finally pulled out of the rubble on Tuesday, Reuters reports, by a Nepali-French rescue team combing the capital city for survivors.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It seems he survived by sheer willpower,&rdquo; said Akhilesh Shreshtha, a doctor who treated him, after it appeared that Khanal had no access to food or water for three days and escaped with nothing but a possible broken leg.<\/p>\n<p>Khanal&rsquo;s rescue was a heartening but rare story from the devastation in Nepal, where a 7.8 magnitude earthquake over the weekend killed more than 5,000 people. That toll is sure to rise significantly as rescue teams move away from Kathmandu, which they began to do early Wednesday, and reach devastated villages near the quake&rsquo;s epicenter.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3835855\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<p>Nepalese Prime Minister Sushil Koirala said the total number of lives lost <a href=\"http:\/\/in.reuters.com\/article\/2015\/04\/28\/quake-nepal-aid-idINKBN0NI1AT20150428\" target=\"_blank\">could ultimately exceed 10,000<\/a>. &ldquo;The government is doing all it can for rescue and relief on a war footing,&rdquo; Koirala told Reuters. &ldquo;It is a challenge and a very difficult hour for Nepal.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>More than 450,000 people have reportedly been displaced from their homes.

seven-storey building he was in collapsed around him during Saturday&rsquo;s massive earthquake in downtown Kathmandu. The 28-year-old was finally pulled out of the rubble on Tuesday, Reuters reports, by a Nepali-French rescue team combing the capital city for survivors.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It seems he survived by sheer willpower,&rdquo; said Akhilesh Shreshtha, a doctor who treated him, after it appeared that Khanal had no access to food or water for three days and escaped with nothing but a possible broken leg.<\/p>\n<p>Khanal&rsquo;s rescue was a heartening but rare story from the devastation in Nepal, where a 7.8 magnitude earthquake over the weekend killed more than 5,000 people. That toll is sure to rise significantly as rescue teams move away from Kathmandu, which they began to do early Wednesday, and reach devastated villages near the quake&rsquo;s epicenter.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3835855\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<p>Nepalese Prime Minister Sushil Koirala said the total number of lives lost <a href=\"http:\/\/in.reuters.com\/article\/2015\/04\/28\/quake-nepal-aid-idINKBN0NI1AT20150428\" target=\"_blank\">could ultimately exceed 10,000<\/a>. &ldquo;The government is doing all it can for rescue and relief on a war footing,&rdquo; Koirala told Reuters. &ldquo;It is a challenge and a very difficult hour for Nepal.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>More than 450,000 people have reportedly been displaced from their homes.

Experts have long warned that the country&rsquo;s vulnerable location at the meeting of two tectonic plates and its slim economic resources made for the perfect storm.<\/p>\n<p>Now, seismologists say that several spots around the world face the potential for an earthquake as least as devastating as the one that hit Kathmandu. &ldquo;Anytime you dump that amount of kinetic energy into a major city, bad things will happen,&rdquo; said Gregory Beroza, a Stanford University seismologist.<\/p>\n<p>This map shows the places that are most likely to experience intense earthquakes (in red), based on a 1999 projection.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/04\/gshap.jpg?quality=65&#038;strip=color&#038;w=560&#038;h=293\" alt=\"gshap_world_map_poster_a0q.cdr\" height=\"293\">\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\" ><span class=\"credit\" >GSHAP<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Here are some of the cities that most concern seismologists:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tehran:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Iranian capital is located near three major fault lines. It&rsquo;s also built on relatively new sediment that doesn&rsquo;t do a great job of supporting buildings when the ground shakes. On top of all that, the city has grown rapidly, and earthquake readiness was not a focus in building new homes. Hoping to reduce the risk of a catastrophe when the big one hits, Iranian officials <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2010\/04\/22\/idUSLDE63C0JG\" target=\"_blank\">created<\/a> financial incentives in 2010 to encourage 5 million Iranians to leave the city. But the city remains large, and the risk of an earthquake is high. There&rsquo;s a 90% chance of a magnitude 6.0 or greater earthquake in the coming decades, according to a Reuters <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2010\/04\/22\/idUSLDE63C0JG\" target=\"_blank\">report<\/a>. And, because of the city&rsquo;s location and poor construction standards, even a quake of that size would be devastating.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Istanbul:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Turkey is no stranger to deadly earthquakes. More than 100,000 people died across the country during earthquakes in the 20th century, according to a World Bank <a href=\"http:\/\/worldbank.mrooms.net\/file.php\/461\/1868\/Istanbul_Erdik_english_edited.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">report<\/a>. And that risk hasn&rsquo;t abated in recent years. Turkey has invested in retrofitting public buildings in Istanbul, the most populous city, but most of the city&rsquo;s inhabitants live in hastily constructed homes that don&rsquo;t meet buildings codes. A 2000 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/288\/5466\/661\" target=\"_blank\">study<\/a> found the city faces a greater than 60% chance of experiencing a magnitude 7.0 earthquake by 2030. A magnitude 7.6 earthquake in the Kocaeli province of Turkey, 75 miles away from Istanbul, killed nearly 1,000 people in Istanbul alone. A similar earthquake in the city center would kill many more.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3838716\"><\/div>\n<p><b>Los Angeles:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Los Angeles, the second most populous city in the United States, has plenty of resources devoted to preventing a humanitarian disaster in the event of a large earthquake. But even cities that spend a lot of time and money preparing still may not be ready for the most devastating earthquakes. The Los Angeles area has a more than two-thirds chance of experiencing a magnitude 6.7 or larger earthquake by 2038, according to a United States Geological Society <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/fs\/2008\/3027\/fs2008-3027.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">report<\/a>. The 1994 Northridge earthquake, a magnitude 6.7 tremor, killed 57 people and caused $20 billion in damage.<\/p>\n<p>More concerning is the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/local\/lanow\/la-me-ln-chance-of-80-earthquake-in-california-rises-usgs-says-20150310-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">7% chance <\/a>of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake in the next 30 years. A magnitude 7.8 tremor could leave 1,800 dead and 50,000 injured and cause $200 billion in damage, according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=1947#.VT_VLWRVhHw\"

The rescue process, coupled with widely published photos of the newborns being cradled by Israeli medics on the Tel Aviv tarmac, has thrust Israel&rsquo;s reliance on Nepalese surrogates into the spotlight, revealing a little known link between Nepal and Israel and starting a debate here about the ethics of international surrogacy.<\/p>\n<p>Only heterosexual couples can easily employ surrogate mothers in Israel. Gay couples and single parents tend to look abroad to bear children with surrogates. For many years, India &mdash; where costs are low but the standard of medical care is generally high &mdash; was the preferred surrogacy option for Israelis, but a change to the law there in 2013 prevented gay men and couples who had been married for less than two years from engaging surrogate mothers. The shift in the law caught many Israelis midway through the surrogacy process. The Indian women travelled to Nepal to give birth and the Israeli surrogacy agencies then switched their operations from India to Nepal.<\/p>\n<p>The first Israeli baby was born to a surrogate mother in Nepal in January 2014, and it is now the destination of choice for Israelis who do not have access to surrogacy in Israel. Many Asian and European countries ban commercial surrogacy, and it can cost up to $150,000 in the United States and Canada but only $30,000 in Nepal.<\/p>\n<p>But while the Israeli government scrambled to evacuate the 26 Israeli newborns and their Israeli parents from Nepal, a further 100 women, some Nepalese, some Indian, are still carrying babies for Israelis. The Israeli Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein said he would allow the most heavily pregnant to be flown to Israel to give birth and outgoing Interior Minister Gilad Erdan promised to remove immigration hurdles for the rest. &ldquo;We have decided to hold off on all the procedures, even if it causes a problem with the Nepalese or Indian governments, so as to bring over the babies as soon as possible,&rdquo; Israeli news sources quoted him as saying on Monday.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3838319\"><\/div>\n<p>The ordeal of the infants and their surrogates has dominated the news coverage of the quake here, with some pundits criticizing the use of government funds to send a rescue mission, and others demanding that Israel reevaluate its own surrogacy laws in the wake of the crisis. An opinion piece in the Haaretz newspaper went one step further, accusing the Israeli public of showing selective empathy by focusing only on the newborn infants, and not the women who had carried them.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;How can it be that none of the human interest stories or compassion-filled posts mentioned these women, who came from a difficult socioeconomic background &hellip; to rent their wombs &hellip; who now, like the babies they&rsquo;ve just had, are also stuck in the disaster zone?&rdquo; writer Alon-Lee Green asked.<\/p>\n<p>Officials on Tuesday said they were continuing to explore options for evacuating the pregnant women. Meanwhile, a delegation from the Red Star of David, Israel&rsquo;s national emergency medical response organization, remained on the ground in Katmandu, where Israel has set up a field hospital.<\/p>\n<p>Yonatan Yagodovsky, director of the Red Star of David&rsquo;s international department, said that in addition to operating the field hospital and assisting local doctors, the evacuation of the newborn children had been his organization&rsquo;s top priority. On Tuesday, all of the infants underwent medical examinations in Israel, and two remained hospitalized.<\/p>\n<p>The future of Israeli surrogacy in Nepal remains up in the air. &#8220;The main concern right now is lack of clean water and things like that,&#8221; said Dana Magdassi, founder of Israel&#8217;s Lotus Surrogacy Agency. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to send someone in for treatment right now, but in one or two months, I think we can definitely reconsider.&#8221;<br \/>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3836404\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div><\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3838319\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n\t<a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Israel%20Evacuates%20Surrogate%20Babies%20From%20Nepal%20But%20Leaves%20the%20Mothers%20Behind%20%7C%20TIME&amp;body=Israel%20Evacuates%20Surrogate%20Babies%20From%20Nepal%20But%20Leaves%20the%20Mothers%20Behind%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3838319%2Fisrael-nepal-surrogates%2F%3Fxid%3Demailshare\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n\t<a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3838319%2Fisrael-nepal-surrogates%2F%3Fxid%3Dfbshare\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n\t<a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1P3b1Hp&amp;text=Israel%20evacuates%20surrogate%20babies%20from%20Nepal%20but%20leaves%20the%20mothers%20behind&amp;via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n\t<a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3838319%2Fisrael-nepal-surrogates%2F%3Fxid%3Dlinkedinshare&amp;title=Israel+Evacuates+Surrogate+Babies+From+Nepal+But+Leaves+the+Mothers+Behind\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n\t<a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment livefyre-commentcount toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3838319\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3838319\/israel-nepal-surrogates\/\" data-title=\"Israel Evacuates Surrogate Babies From Nepal But Leaves the Mothers Behind\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more","world":true},"topic":{"name":"Nepal Earthquake","slug":"nepal-earthquake","left_rail_title":"All Content","left_rail_subhead":"Nepal Earthquake","editor_content":"","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/topic\/nepal-earthquake\/","email_title":"Nepal%20Earthquake | TIME","email_body":"Nepal%20Earthquake%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Ftopic%2Fnepal-earthquake%2F","encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F%2F3839672%2Fnepal-earthquake-death-toll-5000%2F","encoded_shortlink":"","twitter_text":"","encoded_title":"Nepal%20Earthquake","is_vault":false},"tag":{"name":"Nepal Earthquake","slug":"nepal-earthquake","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/topic\/nepal-earthquake\/"},"tags":"Nepal Earthquake","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i0.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/04\/israel-nepal-surrogate-baby.jpg?crop=840px%2C358px%2C1123px%2C1122px&resize=100%2C100&quality=65&strip=color","src":{"small":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/04\/israel-nepal-surrogate-baby.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=280","small_2x":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/04\/israel-nepal-surrogate-baby.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=560","large":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/04\/israel-nepal-surrogate-baby.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=550","large_2x":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/04\/israel-nepal-surrogate-baby.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=1100"},"credit":"Jack Guez\u2014AFP\/Getty Images","caption":"An Israeli gay man carries his baby born to a surrogate mother in Nepal as he is cheered by relatives at Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv on April 28, 2015, following his repatriation from the quake-hit Himalayan nation.

Facebook has also pledged $2 million to the organization&#8217;s relief efforts.

The fact that it only receives around 600,000 visitors each year makes hospitality a key area of potential growth.<\/p>\n<p>Yet most major hotels have now been shuttered for at least a fortnight while structural assessments are completed, and Kathmandu airport has been thronged by shell-shocked vacationers clamoring to escape the bedlam. Airplanes have been held on the tarmac for hours as the besieged terminal struggles to cope with the increased traffic alongside vital aid deliveries.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3836404\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<p>Compounding matters, four of this mountain nation&rsquo;s seven UNESCO World Heritage sites &mdash; such as the 100-foot Dharahara Tower in the capital &mdash; have been severely damaged. At least 18 climbers at the Everest Base Camp died during an avalanche, while the popular hiking hamlet of Langtang has likely been wiped out by a landslide, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/04\/28\/world\/asia\/nepal-earthquake.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0\">according<\/a> to the New York <em>Times.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Rebuilding efforts and hopefully recovery can be quick,&rdquo; Kenichi Yokoyama, Nepal director for the Asian Development Bank, tells TIME. But they will also be uneven.<\/p>\n<p>The service sector and manufacturing &mdash; Nepal boasts industrial plants for many Asian and international firms, including Coca-Cola &mdash; face disruption, as factories have been evacuated indefinitely until structural reports can be compiled. Damage to infrastructure in rural areas could also be significant.<\/p>\n<p><b>MORE: <\/b><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3836242\/nepal-earthquake-donations-disaster-relief\/\" target=\"_blank\">Six Ways you Can Give to Nepal Earthquake Relief<\/a><\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, the farming sector appears to have escaped relatively unscathed. Agriculture remains Nepal&rsquo;s principal economic activity, employing 80% of the population and providing a third of GDP.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Unless land is affected by landslides, or farmers are injured, the agriculture sector may not necessarily suffer major damage,&rdquo; explains Yokoyama.<\/p>\n<p>Then there is hydropower &mdash; the other great hope for Nepal besides tourism. The nation has about 6,000 rivers stretching some 28,000 miles, ranking the nation the second richest globally for inland water resources.<\/p>\n<p>Hydropower is a major source of investment from energy-hungry neighboring superpowers India and China. Nepal is estimated to boast hydropower potential of 80,000MW &mdash; enough to power the whole of Germany &mdash; but only around 700MW has so far been exploited.<\/p>\n<p>Due to poor infrastructure and extreme conditions, and with construction impossible during most ferocious weather, such schemes are exorbitantly expensive; a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/intl\/cms\/s\/0\/ff40a2d2-422c-11e4-a9f4-00144feabdc0.html\">new<\/a> India-backed 900-megawatt dam on the upper Karnali River is slated to cost $1.4 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Yokoyama says the latest quake is unlikely to affect investor confidence in this sector, especially as no major damage has been reported in existing hydropower stations.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3835855\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<p>&ldquo;Everybody would know that Nepal has a high earthquake risk and normally these [hydropower projects] are built to take into account geological and earthquake risks,&rdquo; he says.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"message_content\">&#8220;Hydropower projects are generally &lsquo;over-engineered&rsquo; so as to have a significant margin of safety that takes into account regional conditions,&#8221; confirms Prof. Tony Lucey, a hydropower expert at Curtin University&#8217;s department of engineering in Perth, Australia. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>Nepal&rsquo;s growth was already much slower than most of its South Asian neighbors, and the ABD forecast for this year has been dropped from 4.6% to around 4.2% in light of the quake, says Yokoyama. However, from next year and beyond, reconstruction activity could support faster GDP growth, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. The remittances sent by Nepalis working overseas, which make up about a third of GDP, will also become even more vital.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, a fraught political scene adds unpredictability to the equation. Nepal has not had a fully functioning government since the monarchy was abolished in 2008, with a disparate hodgepodge of bickering Maoist and communist splinter groups creating political inertia. Nepal is also <a href=\"http:\/\/www.transparency.org\/country#NPL\" target=\"_blank\">ranked<\/a> 126 out of 175 nations for corruption by Transparency International. Both of these are going to have to change if Nepalis are to truly rise from the rubble.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\"

The government also attempted to implement a 1998 action plan formulated by disaster-management organizations GeoHazards International and the National Society for Earthquake Technology&ndash;Nepal, but was unable to adequately shore up its defenses.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;People have been trying for a long time to improve preparedness and resilience, but they&rsquo;re resource-strapped,&#8221; Hough said.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MORE<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3836242\/nepal-earthquake-donations-disaster-relief\/?iid=time_speed\" target=\"_blank\">6 Ways You Can Give to Nepal Earthquake Relief<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The rest of the world has <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3837688\/nepal-earthquake-aid-relief-donations\/\">jumped to Nepal&rsquo;s aid<\/a> in the quake&rsquo;s aftermath, with a host of countries ranging from neighbors like India and <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3836182\/china-nepal-earthquake-taiwan-geopolitics\/\">China<\/a> to distant nations like the <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3836657\/nepal-us-aid\/\">U.S.<\/a> and even Israel joining the landlocked Himalayan nation&rsquo;s own people in providing relief-and-rescue assistance. However, the continuing efforts have enforced a bitter sense of how powerless the Nepali government is to care for its own people when faced with calamity.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3837805\"><\/div>\n<p>&ldquo;Our government is not strong enough to handle this,&rdquo; said Kshitiz Nyaupane, a Kathmandu local in his mid-20s. &ldquo;We must take care of it ourselves.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Nyaupane&rsquo;s statement echoes the frustration Nepal&rsquo;s people feel at a political system wracked by decades of indecision, internal conflict and instability.<\/p>\n<p>A decade-long civil war sparked off by a Maoist rebellion <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-south-asia-12499391\">ended in 2006<\/a> after claiming nearly 20,000 lives, and the monarchy that had ruled Nepal since the 1700s was abolished in favor of parliamentary democracy. Competing and <a href=\"http:\/\/world.time.com\/2013\/11\/22\/nepals-maoists-dispute-election-results-raising-fears-of-further-crisis\/\">highly divisive factions<\/a> of Nepali politics have been unable to come to an agreement on a constitution since then, however, and issues like disaster preparedness have taken a backseat amid an impasse that has lasted nearly a decade.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3836404\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<p>&ldquo;We have had no political stability, nine prime ministers in eight years, and we don&rsquo;t have a constitution,&rdquo; Nishchal N. Pandey, director of the Kathmandu-based Centre for South Asian Studies (CSAS), tells TIME. &ldquo;The people are very, very frustrated&rdquo; at Nepal&rsquo;s political and economic paralysis that could well be exacerbated by this disaster, Pandey said.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The government cannot look after everyone,&rdquo; said Tika Regmi, executive director of local trekking company Adventure Mountain Explore Treks &amp; Expedition. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the public like us who has to be careful.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Although all of Regmi&rsquo;s tour groups bound for the base camp of Mount Everest have fortunately been accounted for, he said not a single member of the government, police or army had come to his village of Budhanilkantha (about 11 km from Kathmandu) as of Monday afternoon. &ldquo;Some people don&rsquo;t even have a tent, mattress, blankets or food,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if the government is looking, they may come to us tomorrow or maybe not.&rdquo; Regmi was unreachable on Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>Some believe the government&rsquo;s efforts of the 1990s may have mitigated the extent of the devastation to some degree &mdash; experts had previously predicted that an 8.0-magnitude quake in Kathmandu could kill between 40,000 and 250,000 people, according to University of Colorado professor and South Asian earthquake expert Roger Bilham.<\/p>\n<p>But Pandey says there are certain facts and figures that are inexcusable. &ldquo;Can you imagine that the Nepal army has just one Mi-7 helicopter?&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Just one, for a force of 90,000. This is a grave tragedy.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The CSAS head hopes that the earthquake, as tragic as it is, will be the jolt Nepal&rsquo;s political class needs to get its act together. A fully functioning government would go some way to ensure the next quake, which is surely coming, does not wreak such a hefty toll. &ldquo;So many people have died, our history is completely gone, and if not now, then when will these politicians come together?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><em>&mdash; With reporting by Justin Worland \/ New York<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Read next: <a

Given that nearly <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ekantipur.com\/the-kathmandu-post\/2011\/06\/28\/money\/half-of-nepali-households-have-member-working-abroad-survey\/223411.html\" target=\"_blank\">half<\/a> of all Nepali households send members to work overseas, expatriate Nepalis from the Middle East to East Asia have spent the past few days in a state of panic &mdash; most only able to get notifications from loved ones through short phone calls.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a maximum of couple of minutes. You don&rsquo;t have a long chat. As soon as you find out they are O.K., the call shuts off,&rdquo; says Teg Malla, a spokesperson for the Nepal Youth Foundation in Hong Kong.<\/p>\n<p>Up to 25,000 Nepalis live in China&#8217;s most international city, according to the consulate general of Nepal. The majority are descended from the servicemen of the Brigade of Gurkhas that was stationed in Hong Kong when it was a British colony. That historical connection is unique, as is the community&#8217;s visibility. There are more Nepalis in the U.K. &mdash; some 42,000 &mdash; but they are absorbed into a general population of 64 million. The same goes for the 60,000 Nepalis in the U.S., dwarfed by the population of 318 million, or even the hundreds of thousands of Nepalis in India, lost amid the 1.25 billion members of their host country.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong, however, has a population of just 7 million, and by virtue of its prominence in the service, hospitality and construction centers, as well as its residential concentration in the Kowloon peninsula, the Nepali community here is noticeable in a way that occurs in few other locations around the world. The only other comparisons might be the United Arab Emirates, where the population of some 9.3 million includes around 125,000 Nepalis, or Bahrain and Oman where the Nepali communities are large and growing relative to small local populations.<\/p>\n<p>According to Non-Resident Nepali Association Hong Kong president Durga Bahadur Gurung, the local community has already organized through Nepal Airlines to send an emergency shipment of 1,500 blankets, 1,000 torches and 3,000 batteries to Kathmandu.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was a quick decision within our community. Yesterday we had a meeting of the main Nepali leaders and the Nepali consulate to send the initial relief items,&rdquo; Gurung says.<\/p>\n<p>But with downed power lines and torn-up roads to contend with, 29-year-old Tenzing Rai tells TIME that he is unsure if relief will make it to the communities at highest risk. Rai has been a volunteer for the Hong Kong branch of <a href=\"http:\/\/nepalshare.org\" target=\"_blank\">Nepal Share<\/a>, making trips to Nepal&rsquo;s remotest regions each winter and bringing thousands of blankets and items of clothing each time for underserved villages.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s Nepali domestic workers, many of whom are from impoverished rural areas, face similar logistical hurdles contacting loved ones: &#8220;Some of the Nepali domestic helpers have not been able to get in touch with the families in the remote areas at the epicenter of the earthquake,&rdquo; says Mudita Bajracharya, consul from the Nepali consulate general in Hong Kong. &ldquo;They have been trying to call, but when they cannot get in touch with their family members, they call us. We tried to get the Ministry of Foreign Affairs back in Nepal, but it&#8217;s not easy to find out about individuals.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Aruna Rana, a Nepali shop owner in Hong Kong, is starting her own initiative, collecting parcels of clothes to distribute to quake-affected Nepalis. After talking to her grandmother and sister-in-law, both of whom slept in the open in Kathmandu on Sunday for fear of aftershocks, she realized warm garments were in high demand.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There is a 100% lack of everything in Nepal,&rdquo; Rana tells TIME. &ldquo;It&#8217;s heartbreaking. We never had this kind of destruction in Nepal in my life. I feel helpless to do anything.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3835855\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\"
